# Chopper 3D

Because the world said "you know what I need more of, this in my face"

## Warning

This is a work in progress and is nowhere close to ready yet. It's here for conversation and sharing only, not for
actual use.

## Building and Running

This game is still a work in progress. Eventually it will be available as a wasm based game on <https://adamander.com/>.
As of right now, the wasm build is not yet available, but the auto make build is. I did not attempt to make this program
portable, so maybe it works for you, and maybe it doesn't. I'm probably not going to include everything normally
distributed with a portable build either (not yet anyway).

```shell
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
./chopper
```
